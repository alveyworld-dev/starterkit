### Setting up
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/starterkit
$ cd starterkit
$ python main.py
```

### Resources
* [Intro to game design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11oSHUDFR2WoMJXsoLWD1vtIr-BZaxDjECcIPFVro8iA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Using sprites](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/starterkit/wiki/Sprites)

### Overview
* `resources/` - Any game resources: fonts, sprites, sounds, music, etc.
* `source/` - Game source code
    - `draw.py` - Handles the `draw()` function
    - `game.py` - Global game variables
    - `graphics.py` - Helpful graphics functions
    - `sprite.py` - Sprite class
    - `update.py` - Handles the `update()` function

### Modifications
There are two main parts of the starter kit that you will want to start your
modifications to.

#### Game loop
The game loop is contained in `main.py`, and simply repeats `update` and `draw`
 until exited.

#### Update
`update` is where you will want to do all your math and basic game logic.
```python
def update():
    """
    Update game world here
    """

    # insert logic here
    
    return
```

#### Draw
`draw` is simply that - drawing the game world.  You should refrain from doing
and logic code in `draw`, use it simply for drawing.
```python
def draw():
    """
    Drawing logic
    """

    # Fill the screen with black
    game.screen.fill((240, 240, 240))
    
    # insert logic here

    # Don't change these
    pygame.display.update()
    pygame.display.flip()

    return
```
Notice that there is some code already in the function: you shouldn't change
these unless you know what you are doing.  Simply insert your own code after
the comment "insert logic here".

#### Init
The `game.init` function (located in the `source/game.py` file) can be modified to contain game-wide initilization routines, and is run once before the game loop starts.  It is useful to put variable assignments, resource loading, and any other setup that might need doing here.
```python
...
my_var = 0

def init():
    game.sprites["player"] = Sprite("player.png")
    my_var = game.sprites["player"].rect
    return
```

#### Using sprites
Using the `Sprite` class, it is possible to easily abstract the process of loading images, storing position, and drawing.

A sprite can be created by importing `sprite.Sprite` and providing it the filename of the image that will represent it.
```python
from sprite import Sprite

my_sprite = Sprite("my_image.png")
```
The `Sprite` class contains several useful properties which can be manipulated at runtime:
* `Sprite.rect` - Rectangle describing sprite image, useful for collision detection
* `Sprite.image` - Texture representing the sprite
Sprites can be draw by invoking the `Sprite.draw` function.
```
my_sprite = Sprite("my_image.png")
my_sprite.draw()
```

Inside `game.py` exists a dictionary called `sprites`, which can be used to store and access sprites throughout the game.
```python
import game
from sprite import Sprite

my_sprite = Sprite("my_image.png")
game.sprites["player"] = my_sprite
```
